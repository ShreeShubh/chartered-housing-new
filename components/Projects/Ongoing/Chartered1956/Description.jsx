          <p>
            <span className="font-bold">Chartered 1956</span> isn’t just a name
            — it’s a narrative. A project that draws from the past to redefine
            the present, it stands as a tribute to timelessness, elegance, and
            architectural integrity. This is not just another development; it’s
            our latest masterpiece — a rare blend of luxury and spaciousness we
            proudly call luxcious.

          <p className="font-bold">The Story Behind the Name</p>
          <p>
            In 1956, a piece of land was allotted at the instance of the then
            King of Mysore to the parents of the current owners. Decades later,
            that very land now becomes home to Chartered 1956 — a residence that
            honours this remarkable heritage.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a place where the past is not simply preserved, but lived —
            where each wall, window, and walkway bridges generations. Rooted in
            royal legacy and built for the future, this development embodies
            grace, space, and timeless design.
